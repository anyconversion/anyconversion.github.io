    <h5>Purpose</h5>
    <p>The Angle Conversions category is designed for those working with angular measurements—whether in geometry, physics, engineering, or military applications—offering tools to switch between radians, degrees, gradians, and mils with ease.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>Angular units have deep roots: degrees trace back to ancient Babylon’s 360-day year, radians emerged in the 18th century with calculus, gradians (or gons) were introduced in the French Revolution for metric simplicity, and mils were adopted in the 20th century for military precision. This category connects these legacies.</p>
