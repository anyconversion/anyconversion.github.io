    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A centimeter is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one-hundredth of a meter. An inch is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems, defined as exactly 2.54 centimeters.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The centimeter is part of the metric system developed during the French Revolution in the late 18th century. The metric system was created to establish a universal decimal-based system of measurement, and the centimeter has been a standard unit since its inception. The inch has origins dating back to Anglo-Saxon England, where it was defined as the length of three barleycorns placed end to end. Over time, various standards were used until 1959 when the international yard and pound agreement standardized it as exactly 2.54 centimeters.</p>
