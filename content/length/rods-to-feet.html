    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A rod (also known as a pole or perch) is a unit of length equal to 5.5 yards, 16.5 feet, or exactly 5.0292 meters. The foot is a unit of length defined as 0.3048 meters exactly. One rod is equal to exactly 16.5 feet.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The rod dates back to the Middle Ages and was used extensively in England for land measurement. It represented the typical length of an ox-goad, which was used to control oxen when plowing fields. The rod was standardized in England by the 16th century and was an important unit for surveying. The foot has ancient origins and has been used by many civilizations, though its exact length varied. The current international definition of the foot as exactly 0.3048 meters was established in 1959 by agreement between the United States and countries of the Commonwealth.</p>
