    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A day (d) is a unit of time equal to 24 hours, representing one complete rotation of the Earth around its axis. A week (wk) is a unit of time equal to 7 days, originally based on the phases of the moon.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The seven-day week originated in ancient Mesopotamia and was later adopted by the Jews, spreading through the Roman Empire with the rise of Christianity. The names of the days in many languages reflect their ancient association with celestial bodies: the Sun, Moon, and five visible planets. The modern seven-day week was standardized by Emperor Constantine in 321 CE, who established Sunday as the first day of the week. This system has remained largely unchanged for over 1,700 years.</p>
