    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A fortnight is a period of 14 days (2 weeks). The term comes from the Old English "fēowertȳne niht," meaning "fourteen nights." A day is a unit of time equal to 24 hours, representing one complete rotation of the Earth around its axis.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The term "fortnight" originated in Old English, where time was often reckoned in nights rather than days. "Fēowertȳne niht" (fourteen nights) was shortened over time to "fortnight." The term has remained in common use in British English and some Commonwealth countries, while it is less frequently used in American English. The fortnight had practical significance in medieval times for planning agricultural work, markets, and fairs. It also aligned with the lunar cycle, as half a lunar month is approximately 14 days, making it a natural division of time for early societies.</p>
