    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A lustrum (plural: lustra or lustrums) is a period of five years. The term comes from Ancient Rome, where it was associated with the ceremony of purification (lustratio) that took place every five years after the census. A year is approximately the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, equal to 365.25 days on average.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The concept of the lustrum originated in Ancient Rome, where censuses were conducted every five years starting around 443 BCE. After each census, a ceremony called "lustratio" was performed to purify the Roman people. The term "lustrum" came to denote both the ceremony and the five-year period. While not commonly used in everyday language today, the term has survived in academic and ceremonial contexts, particularly in some European universities that celebrate lustrum anniversaries every five years. The word is derived from the Latin "lustrare," meaning "to purify" or "to review."</p>
