    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A slug is an imperial and US customary unit of mass, defined as the mass that accelerates by 1 ft/s² when a force of one pound-force is exerted on it. It equals approximately 14.59390 kilograms. A kilogram is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI), defined by physical constants since 2019. One slug equals approximately 14.59390 kilograms.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The slug was introduced in the 19th century as a coherent unit of mass in the foot-pound-second (FPS) system of units. It was primarily used in engineering and physics calculations in countries that used imperial units. The name "slug" was chosen to distinguish this mass unit from the pound mass. The kilogram was introduced in France during the French Revolution in the 1790s as part of the metric system. Originally, it was defined as the mass of one liter of water. In 1889, it was redefined as the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram, a platinum-iridium cylinder stored in Sèvres, France. In 2019, it was redefined in terms of fundamental physical constants.</p>
