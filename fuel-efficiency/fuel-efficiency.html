    <h5>Purpose</h5>
    <p>The Fuel Efficiency Conversions category is designed for anyone needing to translate fuel economy metricsâ€”whether for vehicle comparisons, international travel, or regulatory compliance. It bridges US, imperial, and metric systems for practical use.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>Fuel efficiency units evolved with the automotive age: miles per gallon (MPG) emerged in the US in the early 20th century with car standardization, imperial MPG in the UK used a larger gallon, and metric units like kilometers per liter and liters per 100 kilometers gained traction in Europe and beyond post-WWII as global trade grew.</p>
    <h5>Explore More</h5>
    <p>Explore these conversions to see how fuel efficiency varies across systems and optimize your understanding of vehicle performance. Have a suggestion for a new fuel efficiency conversion? <a href="index.html?page=let-us-know" class="text-decoration-none">Let Us Know!</a></p>
