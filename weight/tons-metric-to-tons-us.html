    <h5>Definition</h5>
    <p>A metric ton, also known as a tonne, is a unit of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms or approximately 2,204.62 pounds. A US ton, also known as a short ton, is a unit of weight in the US customary system equal to 2,000 pounds or approximately 907.18 kilograms. One metric ton equals approximately 1.10231 US tons.</p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>The metric ton was introduced as part of the metric system during the French Revolution in the 1790s, defined as the mass of 1 cubic meter of water. It became an official unit in the International System of Units (SI) as the megagram (1,000 kilograms). The US ton, or short ton, evolved from the British "ton" but was standardized differently. The term "ton" originally referred to a large barrel (called a "tun") used for wine shipping. Over time, it evolved into a unit of weight. The US standardized their ton as 2,000 pounds, while the British Imperial ton (or "long ton") was standardized as 2,240 pounds.</p>
